# BETWEEN 1and2 Project - Simple Pages

I just made this simple page after being inspired by TWICE's 'Talk that Talk' MV.. I just made these simple pages to promote Between1and2 album and hype TWICE comeback. Coz I like TWICE so much ~

I created this simple page last year and decided to publish it to github now ~

I made this while studying. This page was created using #Vite #ReactJS #TailwindCSS and #DaisyUI.
